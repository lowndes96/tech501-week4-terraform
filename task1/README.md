```
Using Terraform and Terraform official documentation:

    Create an AWS security group named tech257-firstname-tf-allow-port-22-3000-80 (tf so you know it was created by Terraform)
        Allow port 22 from localhost
        Allow port 3000 from all
        Allow port 80 from all
    Modify the EC2 instance created in main.tf:
        Attach the key to be used with EC2 instance
        Use security group you created
        Test infrastructure was created as intended

        Does Terraform use the push or pull configuration?
        Which is better: push or pull configuration management?
